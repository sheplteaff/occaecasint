// This is a JavaScript code snippet.
// The $(document).ready() function is used to execute code when the DOM (Document Object Model) is fully loaded and ready.
// In this case, it's waiting for the document to be ready before executing the provided arrow function.

// Your code logic or additional functionality can be added inside this function.
// For example:
console.log("Hello, world! This code runs after the document is ready.");
